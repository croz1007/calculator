# Basic Calculator

This basic calculator was created based on a simple assignment a co-worker had for his college programming course. I decided I wanted to just try it on my own having never created one before.

All operations are present (Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide) as well as the use of a decimal point. Future add-ons could be to add in the memory functions, additional operations such as square roots, percentages (using a percent button) and many other things.

Again, this is merely a fun little exercise to do something different for fun.
